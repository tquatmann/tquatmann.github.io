I am a tenured lecturer (Lehrkraft für besondere Aufgaben) in the [Software Modeling and Verification Group](https://moves.rwth-aachen.de) at [RWTH Aachen](https://rwth-aachen.de).
My teaching and research activities evolve around formal methods---in particular model checking.
I am a co-developer of the probabilistic model checking tool [Storm](https://stormchecker.org).
